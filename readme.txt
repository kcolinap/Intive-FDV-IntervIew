Tools

The exercise was developed with the next tools:
1.-IntellijIdea 2017.3.5
2.-Selenium WebDriver 3.8
3.-Google Chrome driver 2.36
4.-Maven quickstart archetype for dependency management
5.-Java sdk 1.8

The test was planned to be run step by step, putting the step number on main class. However, 
user can choose to execute all steps changing the parameter to 0 on the main class. The logic 
of the test was abstracted from the main class and, an intermediary class, makes the call 
to the methods that execute the test.
